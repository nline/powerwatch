Plugwatch G Firmware
====================

## Testing
- Sensing
  - [  ] GPS can get fix - gps_test
  - [  ] GPS PPS line pulses and can be read by particle and STM32 - 1/2 gps_test
  - [  ] Can still set accel Interrupt and read accel angle of board - accel_test
  - [  ] STM32 reads correct voltage out of HV amplifiers
  - [  ] STM32 reads correct voltage out of LV amplifiers
  - [  ] Particle reads correct voltage out of HV amplifiers
  - [  ] Particle reads correct voltage out of LV amplifiers
  - [  ] When HV is applied (i.e. 320VAC) HV amplifiers still work with resolution
  - [  ] When 800V voltage transient is applied detector triggers
  - [  ] STM32 can read voltage angle using PPS
- Communication
  - [  ] Can connect and comm to particle cloud
  - [  ] STM32 and particle can communicate
  - [  ] Can read ID chip - id_chip_test
- Power
  - [  ] 5V supplied when plugged into wall
  - [  ] Battery charges in all states when wall powered
  - [  ] When battery drops below voltage thresh and no wall power particle in RST
  - [  ] When wall power particle never in reset (battery normal or low voltage)
  - [  ] Particle can power on/off SD
  - [  ] Particle can power on/off AC sensing + STM32
  - [  ] Particle can power on/off GPS - gps_test
  - [  ] Particle wakes up when wall power is applied
- Storage
  - [  ] Can write to SD Card
  - [  ] Can read from SD Card
- Time
  - [  ] Write time to RTC
  - [  ] Read time from RTC
  - [  ] RTC maintains time after power off and on
  - [  ] Can set timer on RTC that wakes up Particle (using particle wakeup circuit)
- Programming
  - [  ] Can Program STM32 and STM32 boots
  - [  ] STM reset button works
- Other
  - [  ] Particle can control RGB LED
  - [  ] Particle can set brightness of RGB LED through brightness IC
  - [  ] LEDs are same brightness when powered on
  - [  ] Particle can deterministically hard reset itself (not in a loop) - particle_rst_test
  - [  ] Watchdog triggers when not tickled
